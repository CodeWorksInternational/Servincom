                </h3>
                <h4>Established in 1969, Servincom started working on exporting furniture to Switzerland and manufactured glass-ware
                    to France. Additionally, fruits and vegetables were exported to Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. After the
                    1973 war, Servincom imported bananas from Ecuador via French companies. For more than five years, Servincom
                    was the sole importer in Egypt. Later in the 70’s, Servincom started importing Hochland cheese from Heimenkirch,
                    Germany. In the late 80’s, the company focused on the agricultural business, concentrating on milk and
                    meat productions where we imported special cattle breeds from Holland. Servincom has been a family owned
                    business for more than three generations and is well-known for its reliability, honesty, teamwork and
                    winning passion.
